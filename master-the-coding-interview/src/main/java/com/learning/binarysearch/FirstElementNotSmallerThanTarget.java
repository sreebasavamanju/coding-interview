/**
 * First Element Not Smaller Than Target
 *
 * <p>Given an array of integers sorted in increasing order and a target, find the index of the
 * first element in the array that is larger than or equal to the target. Assume that it is
 * guaranteed to find a satisfying number.
 *
 * <p>Input:
 *
 * <p>arr = [1, 3, 3, 5, 8, 8, 10] target = 2
 *
 * <p>Output: 1
 *
 * <p>Explanation: the first element larger than 2 is 3 which has index 1.
 *
 * <p>Input:
 *
 * <p>arr = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] target = 6
 *
 * <p>Output: 3
 *
 * <p>Explanation: the first element larger than 6 is 7 which has index 3.
